		<h1>What is HTML?</h1>
		</center>
		
		<p>
		The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. 
		It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
		Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. 
		HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages.
		Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML 
		and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML .

		HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material into visual or audible web pages.
		Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by 
		the web page designer's additional use of CSS. Many of the text elements are found in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 Techniques for 
		using SGML, which in turn covers the features of early text formatting languages such as that used by the RUNOFF command developed in the 
		early 1960s for the CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system: these formatting commands were derived from the commands used 
		by typesetters to manually format documents.
