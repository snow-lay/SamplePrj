		<h1>What is Scratch?</h1>
		</center>
		
		<p>
		Scratch is a high-level block-based visual programming language and website targeted primarily at children 8-16 as an educational tool for 
		programming. Users on the site, called Scratchers, can create projects on the web using a block-like interface. Projects can be exported 
		to HTML5, Android apps and EXE files using external tools. The service is developed by the MIT Media Lab, has been translated into 
		70+ languages, and is used in most parts of the world. Scratch is taught and used in after-school centers, schools, and colleges, as well as 
		other public knowledge institutions.

		Scratch takes its name from a technique used by disk jockeys called "scratching", where vinyl records are clipped together and manipulated
		on a turntable to produce different sound effects and music. Like scratching, the website lets users mix together different media 
		(including graphics, sound, and other programs) in creative ways by creating and remixing projects, like video games, animations, 
		and simulations.

		The Scratch interface is divided into three main sections: a stage area, block palette, and a coding area to place and arrange the blocks into
		scripts that can be run by pressing the green flag or clicking on the code itself. Users may also create their own code blocks and they will 
		appear in "My Blocks".The Scratch 3.0 development environment on startup.The stage area features the results (e.g., animations, turtle graphics,
		either in a small or normal size, with a full-screen option also available) and all sprites thumbnails being listed in the bottom area. 
		The stage uses x and y coordinates, with 0,0 being the stage center.
