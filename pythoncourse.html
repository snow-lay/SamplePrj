		Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability
		with its use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers 
		write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.

		Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural)
		, object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard 
		library.Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s, as a successor to the ABC programming language, and first released it in 
		1991 as Python 0.9.0.[32] Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features, such as list comprehensions and a garbage collection 
		system using reference counting. Python 3.0 was released in 2008 and was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible.
		Python 2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020.

		Python was conceived in the late 1980s[38] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to ABC
		programming language, which was inspired by SETL, capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.
		Its implementation began in December 1989. Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018
		when he announced his "permanent vacation" from his responsibilities as Python's Benevolent Dictator For Life, a title the Python community
		bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker.
